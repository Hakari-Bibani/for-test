Welcome to the interactive Acid-Base Titration web app! Here, you will simulate the titration process by adding NaOH drop by drop into a solution of HCl in a conical flask. Let's see how the pH changes and observe the color change at the equivalence point.

- **NaOH in the Burette**: Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution is in the burette, ready to be added to the acid.
- **HCl in the Conical Flask**: Hydrochloric acid (HCl) with phenolphthalein indicator is in the conical flask. The solution is colorless initially.
